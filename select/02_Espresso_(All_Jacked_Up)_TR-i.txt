We're on the road again
Leavin' our load behind us
Put a new message on the answer phone
That they can't find us

The tickets are in my pocket
The shuttle is right on time
Everyone meets at the departure lounge
Half an hour we leave the ground

Let's go get a hot espresso
Or maybe a cappuccino
Say get me a cafe latte
Make it with lots of chocalattay in the middle of it

Let's pull over
I need some magazines
There's an attendant in the ladies room
If you're not squeamish
Which side of the road to drive on?
Here everyone eats so fast
And what was that language that we spoke yesterday?
I made some change so I can pay

To get us some hot espresso
Or maybe a cappuccino
Would you like a cafe latte
Make it with lots of chocalattay in the middle of it

Irish coffee
Sweet and sticky
English toffee
Plain and simple
Tea with honey
Top it off with ginseng royal jelly

In the morning it's a bus to Barcelona
Fly a little side trip over to Roma
Then we all meet in Cannes, Nice, and Monaco
Then it's Venice, Munich, London, San Francisco
Then we drive to Sante Fe and Austin
New Orleans, Atlanta, New York, Boston
Philadelphia, Cleveland Ohio
Columbus, Detroit, coffee stop Chicago
Then it's L.A., Honolulu
Sidney, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Katmandu

And at the end of it all if god is willing
We're sipping Turkish coffee in Greenwich Village

I need a hot espresso, I'm all jacked up!
I need a double espresso, I'm all jacked up!

Hot espresso
Fix me a cappuccino
How about a cafe latte
Make it one with lots of chocalattay in the middle of it

Gimme one more hot espresso
Have another cappuccino
Fire me up a cafe latte
Sprinkle on that lots of chocalattay in the middle of it

Hot espresso, I'm all jacked up!
